Understanding the eCFR API: A Business Overview

What is the eCFR?
The Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR) is an up-to-date, unofficial version of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), provided by the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and the Office of the Federal Register (OFR). It presents federal agency regulations in a structured, searchable, and regularly updated format.

What is the eCFR API?
The eCFR API is a public, machine-readable interface that allows developers and organizations to programmatically access the full structure and content of the eCFR. This enables applications to retrieve regulatory data for use in compliance tools, legal research, data analysis, or web integration.

How It Works
The eCFR API is REST-based and organized around key endpoints that allow users to:
Browse the Table of Contents for the entire eCFR
Retrieve Titles, Chapters, Parts, and Sections
Access specific section text including metadata
Query for updates or changes by date
Retrieve historical versions

All responses are in JSON format, making it easy to parse and integrate into modern web or backend systems.
