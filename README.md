Project: eCFR Analyzer : Federal Regulations

The goal of this project is to create a simple website to analyze Federal Regulations. The eCFR is available at https://www.ecfr.gov/. There is a public api for it.
This code will:
Download the current eCFR and analyze it for items (word count per agency and historical changes over time and any custom metrics.

There will be a front end visualization for the content where we can click around and ideally query items. 
Additionally, there should be a public github project with the code.
