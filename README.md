Project: eCFR Analyzer : Federal Regulations

The goal of this project is to create a simple website to analyze Federal Regulations. The eCFR is available at https://www.ecfr.gov/. There is a public api for it.
This code will:
Download the current eCFR and analyze it for items (word count per agency and historical changes over time and any custom metrics.

There will be a front end visualization for the content where we can click around and ideally query items. 
Additionally, there should be a public github project with the code.

Steps
1.  Analyze the API Endpoints at ecfr.gov
2.  Understand current data structures of each Endpoint
3.  Verify data Endpoints to fullfill requirements (Word Count per Agency and Historical Changes over time)
4.  Review data Endpoints to expand on for Custom Metrics
5.  Document API Endpoint Flow.
